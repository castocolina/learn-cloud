# TODO-FEATURES: New Features and Content Improvements

This file contains new features and content improvements planned for the learn-cloud project.

---

## üîß Navigation Fix in Overview Pages

```markdown
## Text-Based Navigation Problem
**Scope:** Frontend navigation system bug fix
**Affected files:** `src/book/overview.html`, `src/book/*/unit*_overview.html`, `src/book/app.js`, `src/book/navigation.js`, `src/book/style.css`

**Identified problem:**
- Current system evaluates clicks based on component text instead of clear references to target file
- Causes problems on mobile where clicks lead to incorrect content (quiz ‚Üí study aids, content from another topic)
- Lack of consistent identification by URL/ID/name/class
- Problem affects both main overview and individual unit overviews

**Specific tasks:**
1. Review **ALL** overview pages to identify problematic navigation patterns:
   - `src/book/overview.html` (main overview)
   - `src/book/unit1/unit1_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit2/unit2_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit3/unit3_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit4/unit4_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit5/unit5_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit6/unit6_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit7/unit7_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit8/unit8_overview.html`
   - `src/book/unit9/unit9_overview.html`
2. Analyze JavaScript files (app.js, navigation.js) to understand current routing logic
3. Review CSS to identify text-based selectors that should be attribute-based
4. Establish clear rules for component identification:
   - Use `data-target` attributes for navigation destinations
   - Implement unique IDs for each navigable element
   - Use semantic CSS classes instead of text selection
5. Generate specific prompt for agent to fix navigation
6. Create development rules to avoid future regressions

**Main files to review:**
- `src/book/overview.html` (main navigation structure)
- `src/book/unit*/unit*_overview.html` (unit overviews)
- `src/book/app.js` (routing logic)
- `src/book/navigation.js` (navigation system)
- `src/book/style.css` (CSS selectors)

**Deliverables:**
- Navigation rules document
- Prompt for automatic correction
- Navigation refactoring plan
```
