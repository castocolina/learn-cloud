                        <p>It enforces a single, consistent style across the entire codebase, which eliminates all debates and arguments over code formatting. This allows developers to focus on logic and functionality instead of style.</p>

                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p>A linter analyzes the code for potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues that go beyond formatting. It can detect issues like unused imports, undefined variables, and potential security vulnerabilities, which a formatter ignores.</p>

                    <div class="card-back">
                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p>Ruff's key advantage is its speed. Written in Rust, it is significantly faster than traditional Python linters. It also combines the functionality of many tools into one, simplifying the toolchain.</p>

                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p>They automate code quality checks by running tools like Black and Ruff before a commit is created. This ensures that all code entering the repository adheres to the established standards, preventing errors and style inconsistencies from being committed in the first place.</p>
