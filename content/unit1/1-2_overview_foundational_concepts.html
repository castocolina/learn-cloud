                        <h5 class="card-title"><i class="bi bi-stack"></i> Rich Ecosystem & Libraries</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Python boasts one of the most extensive standard libraries and a massive collection of third-party packages available through the Python Package Index (PyPI). For cloud development, this means having battle-tested libraries for nearly every need:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Web Frameworks:</strong> FastAPI, Django, and Flask are mature, powerful, and well-documented.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Science & ML:</strong> Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow integrate seamlessly into backend services.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cloud SDKs:</strong> All major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) offer first-class Python SDKs (like Boto3 for AWS).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

    <!-- Core Language Features -->
    <section id="core-features">
        <h2>Core Language Features: A Refresher</h2>
        <p>As an experienced developer, you're already familiar with fundamental programming constructs. Hereâ€™s a quick, cloud-focused refresher on Python's implementation of these concepts.</p>

        <h4>Data Structures</h4>
        <p>Python's built-in data structures are versatile and efficient. In backend development, you'll constantly be working with them to handle JSON payloads, database records, and more.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Dictionaries (often used for JSON-like objects)
user_data = {
    "id": 101,
    "username": "cloud_dev",
    "roles": ["admin", "editor"]
}
print(f"Username: {user_data['username']}")

# Lists (ordered, mutable collections)
active_sessions = [session_id_1, session_id_2, session_id_3]
active_sessions.append(session_id_4)

# Tuples (ordered, immutable collections)
# Useful for fixed data structures like coordinates or DB records
db_record = ("user123", "user123@example.com", "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z")
user_id, email, created_at = db_record
        </code></pre>

            <pre class="mermaid">
                graph TD
                    subgraph Python Data Structures
                        A[Dictionary] --> B{Key 1};
                        B --> C[Value 1];
                        A --> D{Key 2};
                        D --> E[Value 2];

                        F[List] --> G[0: Element 1];
                        G --> H[1: Element 2];

                        I[Tuple] --> J("(0: Element 1)");
                        J --> K("(1: Element 2)");

        </div>

        <h4>Functions and Classes</h4>
        <p>Python's support for both functional and object-oriented programming provides flexibility. In cloud applications, you'll use functions for stateless operations (like in serverless functions) and classes to model complex entities and business logic.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# A simple function for a stateless operation
def calculate_tax(amount: float, rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculates the tax for a given amount."""
    return amount * rate

# A class to represent a more complex entity
class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id: int, username: str):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.username = username
        self.is_active = True

    def deactivate(self):
        self.is_active = False
        print(f"User {self.username} has been deactivated.")

# Usage
user = User(101, "cloud_dev")
user.deactivate()

    <!-- Python's Typing System -->
    <section id="typing-system">
        <h2>Python's Typing System: Writing Production-Ready Code</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most critical topics for writing reliable, production-grade Python. While Python is dynamically typed, the introduction of <strong>type hints</strong> (as specified in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/" target="_blank">PEP 484</a>) revolutionized how we build large-scale applications. They provide clarity, help catch errors early, and enable powerful tooling.</p>

        <h4>Type Hints</h4>
        <p>Type hints are annotations that specify the expected type of variables, function parameters, and return values. They do not enforce types at runtime but are used by static analysis tools to prevent bugs.</p>
        
        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <pre class="mermaid">
                graph TD
                    A[Python Code with Type Hints] --> B(Static Analysis Tool);
                    B --> C{Type Checker};
                    C --> D["Errors/Warnings/Success"];
                    E["Type Stubs (.pyi)"] --> C;
                    F["Configuration File (e.g., pyproject.toml, mypy.ini)"] --> B;
                    B -- Uses --> G[Standard Library Types];
                    B -- Uses --> H[Third-Party Library Types];
            </pre>
            <small class="text-muted">Diagram: Static Analysis Workflow with Type Hints</small>
        </div>

        <pre><code class="language-python">
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def get_user_by_id(user_id: int) -> Optional[Dict[str, any]]:
    """
    Fetches a user from a database.
    
    Args:
        user_id: The integer ID of the user.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with user data if found, otherwise None.
    """
    # In a real app, you would query a database here.
    if user_id == 1:
        return {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
    return None

# A static type checker like MyPy would flag this incorrect usage:
# get_user_by_id("not-an-int")
        </code></pre>

        <h4>Tooling Spotlight: Pydantic</h4>
        <p>While type hints provide static analysis, <strong>Pydantic</strong> takes it a step further by providing <em>runtime</em> type checking and data validation. This is a game-changer for building APIs, as it allows you to define data shapes with Python classes and automatically validate, serialize, and deserialize data.</p>
        <p>Pydantic is the backbone of modern Python web frameworks like FastAPI for its robustness and ease of use.</p>

        <div class="card bg-light mb-3">
            <div class="card-header">Why Pydantic is Essential</div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">In a distributed system, you cannot trust the data coming from external clients or even other internal services. Pydantic acts as a protective barrier at the edge of your application, ensuring that all incoming data conforms to the expected schema before your business logic ever sees it. This prevents a massive class of bugs related to unexpected data types or missing fields.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Let's see a practical example. Imagine you are defining the data model for a user profile in an API.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, HttpUrl
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: EmailStr  # Pydantic provides special types for common formats
    join_date: datetime
    bio: Optional[str] = None # An optional field with a default of None
    website: Optional[HttpUrl] = None
    tags: List[str] = [] # A list that defaults to empty

# Example of creating a valid user profile
# Pydantic will automatically convert the string date to a datetime object
valid_data = {
    "username": "cloud_ninja",
    "email": "ninja@example.com",
    "join_date": "2023-10-27T12:00:00Z",
    "website": "https://example.com"
}
user_profile = UserProfile(**valid_data)
print(user_profile.json(indent=2))

# Example of invalid data that Pydantic will reject
invalid_data = {
    "username": "bad_user",
    "email": "not-an-email", # This will raise a validation error
    "join_date": "yesterday" # This is not a valid ISO 8601 date
}

try:
    UserProfile(**invalid_data)
except Exception as e:
    print("\n--- Pydantic Validation Error ---")
    print(e)
        </code></pre>
        <p>By using Pydantic, you get data validation, serialization (e.g., to JSON), and documentation all in one place, making your code cleaner, more robust, and easier to maintain.</p>
