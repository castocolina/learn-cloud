                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p><strong>Monitoring</strong> tells you <em>if</em> something is broken (e.g., CPU usage is high). <strong>Observability</strong> helps you understand <em>why</em> it's broken by allowing you to ask arbitrary questions about the system's internal state from its external outputs.</p>

                        <p>The three pillars of observability are <strong>Logs</strong>, <strong>Metrics</strong>, and <strong>Traces</strong>.</p>

                        <h5>Structured Logging</h5>
                        <p>What is structured logging, and what is its main benefit?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-back">
                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p>Structured logging involves outputting logs in a machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) with key-value pairs. Its main benefit is making logs easier to parse, query, and analyze programmatically, especially in distributed systems.</p>

                        <h5>Prometheus Metrics</h5>
                        <p>What are metrics in the context of observability, and what is Prometheus used for?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-back">
                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p>Metrics are numerical measurements collected over time (e.g., request rates, error counts). Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects and stores these metrics as time series data, allowing for powerful querying and alerting.</p>

                    <div class="card-back">
                        <h6>Answer</h6>
                        <p>Distributed tracing solves the problem of understanding the flow and performance of a single request as it travels through multiple services. It helps pinpoint latency issues, identify service dependencies, and debug complex interactions across a distributed system.</p>
