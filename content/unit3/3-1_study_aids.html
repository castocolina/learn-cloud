                <h4>Question 1</h4>
                <p>What is Infrastructure as Code and how does Terraform implement it?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes. Terraform uses HCL to declaratively define resources and maintains state to track infrastructure changes.</p>

                <h4>Question 2</h4>
                <p>What are the key benefits of using DevOps practices in cloud-native development?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>DevOps practices enable faster delivery cycles, improved collaboration between teams, automated testing and deployment, reduced manual errors, better scalability, and more reliable systems through continuous integration and monitoring.</p>

                <p>How does containerization support DevOps and continuous delivery?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>Containers provide consistent environments across development, testing, and production. They enable rapid deployment, easy scaling, resource isolation, and simplified rollbacks, making continuous delivery more reliable and efficient.</p>
