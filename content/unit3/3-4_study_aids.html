                <h4>Question 1</h4>
                <p>What is Automated Canary Analysis in Spinnaker and how does it work?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>ACA is Spinnaker's feature that automatically compares a new canary version against a baseline using real-time metrics. It uses statistical analysis to produce a risk score and can automatically promote, fail, or wait for human approval based on thresholds.</p>

                <h4>Question 2</h4>
                <p>What are the key benefits of using DevOps practices in cloud-native development?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>DevOps practices enable faster delivery cycles, improved collaboration between teams, automated testing and deployment, reduced manual errors, better scalability, and more reliable systems through continuous integration and monitoring.</p>

                <h4>Question 3</h4>
                <p>How does containerization support DevOps and continuous delivery?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>Containers provide consistent environments across development, testing, and production. They enable rapid deployment, easy scaling, resource isolation, and simplified rollbacks, making continuous delivery more reliable and efficient.</p>
