                <h4>Question 1</h4>
                <p>What is the difference between Deployments and StatefulSets in Kubernetes?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>Deployments manage stateless applications where pods are interchangeable, while StatefulSets provide stable network identifiers, ordered deployment/scaling, and persistent storage for stateful applications like databases.</p>

                <p>What are the key benefits of using DevOps practices in cloud-native development?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>DevOps practices enable faster delivery cycles, improved collaboration between teams, automated testing and deployment, reduced manual errors, better scalability, and more reliable systems through continuous integration and monitoring.</p>

            <div class="flashcard-back">
                <h4>Answer</h4>
                <p>Containers provide consistent environments across development, testing, and production. They enable rapid deployment, easy scaling, resource isolation, and simplified rollbacks, making continuous delivery more reliable and efficient.</p>
