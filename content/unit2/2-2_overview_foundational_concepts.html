        <h1>2.2 Overview & Foundational Concepts</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="lead">Now that your Go environment is ready, let's explore the foundational concepts of the language. Coming from a language like Python, you'll find Go to be refreshingly simple yet powerful. It's statically typed, compiled, and built with concurrency as a first-class citizen. This topic will bridge your existing programming knowledge to the Go way of thinking, focusing on the features most relevant to building high-performance backend services.</p>

        <h2>Core Language Features: A Tour for the Experienced Developer</h2>
        <p>Let's walk through Go's core constructs, highlighting how they compare to what you already know.</p>

        <h4>Packages, Variables, and Functions</h4>
        <p>Every Go program is made up of packages. The `main` package is the entry point for an executable program. Variables can be declared with `var` or with the `:=` short assignment statement, which infers the type. While `:=` feels like Python's dynamic assignment, it's important to remember that Go is still statically typed; the compiler just infers the type for you at compile time.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import "fmt" // Importing the standard formatting package

// A function that takes two integers and returns an integer
// Notice the type comes AFTER the variable name.
func add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    // Using the short assignment statement, 'sum' is inferred to be of type int.
    sum := add(42, 13)
    fmt.Println("The sum is:", sum)
}
        </code></pre>

        <h4>Control Flow and Idiomatic Error Handling</h4>
        <p>Go's control flow is simple (`if`, `for`, `switch`). There are no `while` or `do-while` loops; the `for` loop handles everything. The most important pattern to learn is Go's approach to error handling. Functions that can fail return an `error` as the last return value. The caller is expected to check if the error is `nil` immediately. This explicit error handling is a core tenet of Go philosophy, contrasting with the exception-based `try...except` blocks in Python.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-go">
import (
    "fmt"
    "strconv"
)

func main() {
    // The second return value is the potential error
    num, err := strconv.Atoi("123")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle the error and return early. This is the idiomatic Go way.
        fmt.Println("Error converting string to int:", err)
        return
    }

    // If err is nil, we can safely use the value
    fmt.Println("Successfully converted to number:", num)
}
        </code></pre>

                    A[Call Function That Can Fail] --> B{Check: err != nil?};
                    B -- Yes (Error Occurred) --> C[Handle Error and Return Early];
                    B -- No (Success) --> D[Continue Normal Execution];

        <h4>Composite Types: Structs, Slices, and Maps</h4>
        <p>Go provides powerful composite types for structuring data. Here's how they map to concepts you might know from Python:</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Go Type</th>
                    <th>Python Equivalent</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>struct</code></td>
                    <td><code>class</code> (especially <code>@dataclass</code>)</td>
                    <td>A collection of named fields, used to group data together.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>slice</code></td>
                    <td><code>list</code></td>
                    <td>A dynamic, flexible view into an underlying array. The most common sequence type in Go.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>map</code></td>
                    <td><code>dict</code></td>
                    <td>An unordered collection of key-value pairs.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import "fmt"

// A struct is a collection of fields. Think of it like a lightweight class or a C struct.
type User struct {
    ID       int
    Username string
    IsActive bool
}

func main() {
    // Initializing a struct
    user1 := User{ID: 1, Username: "cloud-dev", IsActive: true}
    fmt.Printf("User: %+v\n", user1)

    // A slice is a flexible view into an array. Similar to a Python list.
    roles := []string{"admin", "editor"}
    roles = append(roles, "viewer") // Add an element
    fmt.Println("Roles:", roles)

    // A map is a key-value store. Similar to a Python dictionary.
    permissions := make(map[string]bool)
    permissions["can_write"] = true
    permissions["can_read"] = true
    fmt.Println("Permissions:", permissions)
}
        </code></pre>

        <h4>Pointers</h4>
        <p>Unlike Python, where all variables are essentially references, Go gives you direct access to pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value. This is crucial for performance and for writing functions that can modify their arguments. Use `&` to get the address of a variable and `*` to "dereference" a pointer, getting the value it points to.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-go">
package main

import "fmt"

type User struct {
    Username string
}

// This function receives a POINTER to a User (*User).
// This allows it to modify the original User object.
func deactivateUser(u *User) {
    u.Username = u.Username + "_deactivated"
}

func main() {
    user := User{Username: "alice"}
    fmt.Println("Before:", user.Username) // Prints "alice"

    // Pass the memory address of the user variable to the function.
    deactivateUser(&user)

    fmt.Println("After:", user.Username) // Prints "alice_deactivated"
}
        </code></pre>

        <h2>The Power of Interfaces: Composition Over Inheritance</h2>
        <p>This is one of Go's most elegant and powerful features. An <strong>interface</strong> is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. A type is said to implement an interface if it has all the methods defined in that interface. There is no `implements` keyword; the satisfaction is implicit. This is a major departure from languages like Java or Python (with ABCs) where implementation must be explicitly declared.</p>
        <p>This promotes a form of polymorphism and enables extreme decoupling. You can write functions that operate on interfaces, and any type that satisfies the interface can be used, without them needing to know about each other. This is a cornerstone of building testable and maintainable microservices.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Go's foundational concepts are intentionally minimal but powerful. By embracing static typing, explicit error handling, and implicit interfaces, Go provides the tools to build simple, reliable, and highly performant backend services. These core features provide the bedrock upon which Go's famous concurrency model is built, which we will explore in the next topic.</p>
