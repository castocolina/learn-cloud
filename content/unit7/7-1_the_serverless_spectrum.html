        <h1>7.1: The Serverless Spectrum</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="lead">Welcome to Unit 7. We now enter the world of <strong>serverless computing</strong>, a paradigm that further abstracts away infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus purely on application logic. Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers; it means you, the developer, don't have to manage them. This topic explores the serverless philosophy and introduces the two main models on AWS: Function as a Service (FaaS) with AWS Lambda and serverless containers with AWS Fargate.</p>

    <h2><i class="bi bi-cloud-check"></i> 1. The Serverless Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The core idea of serverless is to shift the responsibility of managing infrastructure—provisioning, scaling, patching, and maintenance—entirely to the cloud provider. This enables several key benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Server Management:</strong> You never have to provision, patch, or manage any servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay-for-Value:</strong> You are billed only for the exact resources consumed during execution, often measured in milliseconds. You never pay for idle capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Scaling:</strong> The platform automatically scales your application in response to demand, from zero to thousands of requests per second.</li>
        <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Serverless platforms are inherently highly available and fault-tolerant across multiple availability zones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i class="bi bi-box"></i> 2. AWS Lambda: Function as a Service (FaaS)</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a> is the quintessential FaaS offering. It allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. You upload your code as a "Lambda function," and the platform handles everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.
    </p>
    <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Function:</strong> A piece of code that runs on Lambda. You can write functions in many languages, including Python and Go.</li>
        <li><strong>Event:</strong> The trigger that invokes your function. This can be an HTTP request from API Gateway, a new file in an S3 bucket, a message in an SQS queue, and many other sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution Environment:</strong> A temporary, isolated container where your function code runs. AWS manages creating and tearing down these environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i class="bi bi-box-seam"></i> 3. AWS Fargate: Serverless Containers</h2>
    <p>
        What if you have an existing containerized application that you want to run without managing servers? This is where <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank">AWS Fargate</a> comes in. Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
    </p>
    <p>
        With Fargate, you no longer need to provision, configure, or scale a cluster of virtual machines to run your containers. You simply package your application in a container, specify the CPU and memory it requires, and Fargate launches and manages the containers for you.
    </p>

    <h2><i class="bi bi-question-lg"></i> 4. Comparing Lambda vs. Fargate</h2>
    <p>Choosing between Lambda and Fargate depends on your application's architecture, performance requirements, and existing codebase.</p>
