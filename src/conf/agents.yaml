# =============================================================================
# AGENTS CONFIGURATION FILE
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: This file defines specialized AI agents for different development tasks.
# Each agent has a specific role, expertise area, and is optimized for particular
# types of problems using different reasoning frameworks.
#
# Structure:
# - id: Unique identifier (2-3 letters + 2 digits)
# - name: Human-readable agent name
# - agent_name: LLM provider (claude/gemini)
# - model: Primary model (sonnet/haiku/gemini-2.5-pro)
# - fallback_model: Backup model if primary fails (Claude only)
# - framework: Reasoning approach (ReAct, CoT, TDD, etc.)
# - param_yolo_mode: Flag for direct file modification capability
# - edition_available: Boolean flag to enable/disable file editing permissions
# - param_continue: Flag for session continuation (Claude only)
# - param_json_output: Flag for structured JSON output (Claude only)
# - param_json_stream_output: Flag for streaming JSON with verbose and partial messages (Claude only)
# - description: Agent's specialized capabilities and role
#
# Permission Flags:
# - Claude agents: Use "--dangerously-skip-permissions" for direct file modification
#   Note: Claude supports fallback models, session continuation with "--continue", 
#         JSON output with "--output-format json", and streaming JSON with 
#         "--output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages"
# - Gemini agents: Use "--yolo" for direct file modification
#   Note: Gemini does NOT support fallback models, session continuation, or JSON output
#
# Usage Examples:
# - claude --model sonnet --fallback-model haiku --dangerously-skip-permissions --continue --output-format json -p "prompt content"
# - claude --model sonnet --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages -p "prompt content"
# - gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro --yolo -a -p "prompt content"
#
# Usage: These agents are referenced by the prompt management system to delegate
# tasks to the most appropriate specialist based on the problem domain.
