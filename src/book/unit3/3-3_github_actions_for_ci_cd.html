        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> An automated process defined by a YAML file in the <code>.github/workflows</code> directory of your repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Event:</strong> A specific activity that triggers a workflow, such as a <code>push</code>, <code>pull_request</code>, or a schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Job:</strong> A set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially.</li>
            <li><strong>Step:</strong> An individual task that can run commands or an <strong>action</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> A reusable piece of code that performs a complex but common task (e.g., checking out code, logging into a cloud provider).</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Building a Workflow -->
        <h2><i class="bi bi-gear-wide-connected"></i> 1. Building a CI Workflow for a Go Application</h2>
        <p>Let's create a CI pipeline for a typical Go project. This workflow will trigger on every push and pull request, and will have jobs for linting, testing, and building the application.</p>
        <p>Create the file <code>.github/workflows/ci.yml</code>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-yaml">
name: Go CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ &quot;main&quot; ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ &quot;main&quot; ]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

        <!-- Secrets Management -->
        <h2><i class="bi bi-key"></i> 2. Managing Secrets in GitHub Actions</h2>
        <p>
            You should never hardcode secrets (like passwords, API keys, or tokens) in your workflow files. GitHub provides <strong>Encrypted Secrets</strong> for this purpose. You can store secrets at the repository or organization level, and they are exposed to workflows as environment variables.
        </p>
        <p>To add a secret, go to your repository's <code>Settings &gt; Secrets and variables &gt; Actions</code>.</p>

        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <pre class="mermaid">
  <script type="text/plain">
    graph TD
                A["GitHub Secrets UI"] -- "User adds secret" --> B["Encrypted Storage"];
                B -- "Injects at runtime" --> C["Workflow Runner"];
                C -- "Exposes as Env Var or Input" --> D["Step using the secret"];
                D -- "e.g., docker login -u user -p ***" --> E["External Service"];

    <section>
        <!-- Docker Integration -->
        <h2><i class="bi bi-box-seam"></i> 3. Building and Pushing Docker Images</h2>
        <p>
            A common CI/CD task is to build a Docker image and push it to a container registry like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). We can add a new job to our workflow for this, using the secrets we just learned about.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-yaml">
# Add this job to your ci.yml file
  build-and-push-docker:
    name: Build and Push Docker Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build # Depends on the successful build job
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: yourdockerhubusername/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
    </code></pre>
        <p>This job uses community-developed actions to handle the Docker login and build/push logic, and it dynamically tags the image with the Git commit SHA for traceability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <!-- Kubernetes Deployment -->
        <h2><i class="bi bi-cloud-upload"></i> 4. Deploying to Kubernetes</h2>
        <p>
            The final step is deploying our containerized application to Kubernetes. This requires giving the GitHub Actions runner secure access to your cluster. This is typically done by storing a <code>kubeconfig</code> file as a secret.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-yaml">
# Add this job to your ci.yml file
  deploy-to-k8s:
    name: Deploy to Kubernetes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-push-docker
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Kubeconfig
        uses: azure/k8s-set-context@v3
        with:
          method: kubeconfig
          kubeconfig: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }} # Store your kubeconfig file as a secret

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v4
        with:
          action: &#x27;deploy&#x27;
          manifests: |
            k8s/deployment.yaml
            k8s/service.yaml
          images: |
            yourdockerhubusername/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
    </code></pre>
        <p>This job checks out the code, configures <code>kubectl</code> using the provided secret, and then applies the Kubernetes manifests, updating the image tag to the one we just built.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <!-- Reusable Actions -->
        <h2><i class="bi bi-recycle"></i> 5. Creating Reusable Actions</h2>
        <p>
            To avoid duplicating code across multiple workflows, you can create your own reusable actions. A <strong>composite action</strong> allows you to bundle multiple workflow steps into a single action.
        </p>
        <p>Create the file <code>.github/actions/setup-go-env/action.yml</code>:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-yaml">
name: &#x27;Setup Go Environment&#x27;
description: &#x27;Checks out code and sets up a specific Go version&#x27;
runs:
  using: &quot;composite&quot;
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v4
      with:
        go-version: &#x27;1.22&#x27;
    </code></pre>
        <p>Now you can replace the first two steps in your jobs with a single line:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-yaml">
    steps:
      - name: Setup Go Environment
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-go-env
    </code></pre>
