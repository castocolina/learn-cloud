    <p class="lead">We've now seen how to find vulnerabilities in our code (SAST), our dependencies (SCA), and our container images. But finding vulnerabilities is only the first step. <strong>Vulnerability Management</strong> is the continuous, cyclical process of identifying, prioritizing, remediating, and verifying vulnerabilities. A mature DevSecOps culture requires a systematic approach to managing the vulnerabilities we discover.</p>

    <h2><i class="bi bi-arrow-repeat"></i> The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>Vulnerability management is not a one-time task; it's a continuous lifecycle that feeds back into the development process.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Discover:</strong> This is what we've done in the previous topics. We use automated tools (SAST, SCA, image scanners) integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to continuously discover new vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Not all vulnerabilities are created equal. A high-severity vulnerability in a non-production, internal-only service is less urgent than a medium-severity vulnerability in a public-facing authentication service. Prioritization involves assessing the risk a vulnerability poses to your specific application.</li>
        <li><strong>Remediate:</strong> This is the act of fixing the vulnerability. This could involve updating a dependency to a non-vulnerable version, patching your own code, or applying a mitigating control (like a firewall rule) if a direct fix isn't possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify:</strong> After a fix is applied, you must verify that the vulnerability is actually gone. This is typically done by re-running the same tool that originally discovered it.</li>
    </ol>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-sort-numeric-down"></i> 2. Strategies for Prioritization</h2>
    <p>A typical scan can reveal hundreds of vulnerabilities. Trying to fix everything at once is impossible and inefficient. Effective prioritization is key.</p>

    <h4>CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</h4>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/" target="_blank">CVSS</a> is the industry standard for rating the severity of a vulnerability. It provides a numerical score (0.0 to 10.0) based on a set of metrics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low:</strong> 0.1 - 3.9</li>
        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> 4.0 - 6.9</li>
        <li><strong>High:</strong> 7.0 - 8.9</li>
        <li><strong>Critical:</strong> 9.0 - 10.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While CVSS score is the primary input for prioritization, it's not the only one.</p>

    <h4>Context is King</h4>
    <p>You must combine the CVSS score with the business context of the affected application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Is the vulnerable code reachable?</strong> A vulnerability in a library is irrelevant if your application never calls the vulnerable function. (This is where tools like `govulncheck` shine).</li>
        <li><strong>Is the service internet-facing?</strong> A vulnerability in a public-facing API is much more critical than one in an internal batch processing job.</li>
        <li><strong>What data does the service handle?</strong> A vulnerability in a service that processes sensitive customer data (PII) is more critical than one in a service that handles public, non-sensitive data.</li>
    </ul>

            <h2><i class="bi bi-calendar2-check"></i> 3. Remediation and SLAs</h2>
    <p>
        Once a vulnerability is prioritized, it needs to be assigned for remediation. A common practice is to establish <strong>Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</strong> for fixing vulnerabilities based on their severity. These SLAs define the maximum amount of time a team has to fix a vulnerability once it's discovered.

            </tr>

                <td><strong>Critical</strong></td>
                <td>24 - 72 hours</td>
                <td>All-hands-on-deck, immediate patch required. May require breaking the build.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>High</strong></td>
                <td>7 - 30 days</td>
                <td>Must be fixed in the current or next development sprint.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Medium</strong></td>
                <td>60 - 90 days</td>
                <td>Scheduled as regular technical debt.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Low</strong></td>
                <td>180+ days or Accept Risk</td>
                <td>Fix when convenient or formally accept the risk if the cost of fixing is too high.</td>
            </tr>

            <p>These SLAs provide clear expectations for development teams and a measurable way to track and improve the organization's security posture over time.</p>
